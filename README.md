# Project 1 (Done)
- Project 1 is the implementation of basic logic gates in HDL.
- It contains the following basic logic gates: And, And16, Not, Not16, Or, Or16, Or8Way, Xor.
- And the following basic (de)multiplexors: Mux, Mux16, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16 DMux, DMux4Way DMux8Way.

# Project 2 (Current)
- Project 2 is the implementation of basic chips to perform boolean arithmetic.
- Finished: HalfAdder
- Not Finished: FullAdder, Add16, Inc16, ALU.
